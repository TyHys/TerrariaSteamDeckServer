I want you to fill out the @development-plan.md for our Terraria Steam Deck Server code repository. Please review the @goal.md of the project to understand what needs to be accomplished.

Do not write any code at this time. Simply build the plan.

Please ask me any questions necessary before you begin creating the plan.
